**How to import CSV to Excel**

Using this method you can import data from a csv file to a new Excel worksheet.

1. Open a new Excel spreadsheet, click the cell where you want to import the data from a .csv

2. On the Data tab, in the Get External Data group, click From Text.

3. Browse for the csv file you want to import, select it and click the Import button (or simply double click the .csv file)

4. The Text Import Wizard will appear and you follow these steps:

Step 1:

Choose the file type and the row number to start importing the data. Typically, you choose Delimited and row 1, respectively. The preview window in the lower part of the wizard shows the first few entries of your CSV file.

Step 2:

In this step, you select a delimiter(s) and text qualifier. Delimiter is the character that separates values in your .csv file.

Text qualifier is the character that wraps the values in your text file.

Step 3:

If you are happy with the Data preview, then click the Finish button.

5. Choose the destination for the imported data, you can choose either an existing or a new worksheet, and click OK to finish importing your CSV file to Excel.

**_Note_**: If your CSV file contains some numerical data or dates, Excel may not convert these values correctly. To change the format of the imported data, select the problematic column(s) in Excel, right click and choose Format cells from the context menu.
